#As the saying goes, it brings bad luck
#not starting a new programming language study
#without a 'hello world' code

#For some reason, mr Mueller
#asked for a different message, 
#but i prefer to stick with 
#the original one, at least for the
#first code

print("Hello, world!")

print("Ol√°, mundo!")
