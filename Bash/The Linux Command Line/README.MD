## About this section 

I can't express enough how important this book is for anyone who wants to learn how to use the bash command line, not only programmers, but normal people who have interest in computers as well.

Unix is essentially the Latin of the computer languages nowadays, and Linux tries to carry its legacy to the best of its ability, hence learning how to use the command line in Linux is the closest you will get to learning Unix, which is exactly what this book does in the ultimate case.

## Instructions

Each file inside this folder consists of a bash source code file ('.sh') representing an entire chapter of the book. You can either save and run these files on your Linux machine (or Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux), which will run the code as it is, but ideally you will read the commented sections and individually run the examples as they are shown. To do this, you need to open a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type them on the go.

An important note if you do pretend to run it as a script; at some situations, pages like less may pop up, which will requires your input to keep the script running for its next steps. In order to do it, you may exit these pages pressing 'q' or 'ctrl d' or 'ctrl c' depending of the context.

Alternatively, you can read the book, which would be better.
